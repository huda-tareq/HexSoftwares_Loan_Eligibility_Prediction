Uses the same preprocessing steps applied during training

Ensures consistency between training and deployment


📝 User Inputs in the App

The Streamlit application collects the following inputs:

Gender

Marital Status

Number of Dependents

Education Level

Employment Status

Applicant Income

Loan Amount

Credit History

Based on these inputs, the model predicts whether the loan will be Approved or Not Approved.


🛠️ Technologies Used
